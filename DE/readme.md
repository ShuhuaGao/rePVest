# Source code for simple differential evolution (DE)
The DE algorithm is implemented with the  [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language (version 1.5.0 or higher). We write the code in [ Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for enhanced readability. Some technical details are also explained in the notebook. The core DE algorithm is implemented in our another package [DifferentialEvolution.jl](https://github.com/ShuhuaGao/DifferentialEvolution.jl) (it will be installed automatically if you follow the steps below).
## Overview of files in the *src* directory
- models.jl: 

Julia code in a text file that defines the single- and double- diode models as well as functions to compute the SSE and RMSE. These functions are used in the notebook below.
- DE.ipynb

Julia code written with Jupyter notebook that produces all DE results and figures in our paper.
- The *data* subfolder contains the two benchmark datasets.

## How to view the code files online
You can view these files directly on GitHub just by clicking them, e.g., the pretty notebook  [DE.ipynb](./src/DE.ipynb) and the associated results generated by the code on our PC therein.
## How to run the code locally
1. Make sure that you have the Julia language (version >= 1.5.0) and the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) kernel for Jupyter notebook installed.
2. Download or clone this [rePVest](https://github.com/ShuhuaGao/rePVest) repository into your local PC.
3. Change into the *rePVest* root folder and launch the Julia REPL there.
4. Instantiate the Julia environment as specified by our *Project.toml*  and *Manifest.toml* by typing the following command in Julia REPL
```julia-repl
]instantiate
```
During the instantiation process, all required packages will be installed automatically.

5. In another terminal like Windows PowerShell, change into the *DE/src* subfolder , and launch Jupyter notebook by `jupyter notebook`. Then the notebook file`DE.ipynb` can be opened and run there. 

(You may also follow the instructions given by [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) to start the Jupyter notebook.)

## How to run the code online
The great [binder](https://mybinder.org/) service supports execution of Jupyter notebooks online. You can check and run our *DE.ipynb* directly with binder online by clicking the following badge.
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ShuhuaGao/rePVest/HEAD)

and then open the *DE/src/DE.ipynb* file.

Note however that the cloud PC configuration and the installed Julia version in binder are different from ours. Thus, it is expected that the results and the measured running time differ from our reported ones.
