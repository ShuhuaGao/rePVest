# MATLAB implementation of the simple DE method

This implementation is mainly used for runtime comparison, because most existing studies code their methods in MATLAB. Please refer to Fig. 4 in the paper for more details.

The MATLAB source code of existing methods is mostly available at <http://www5.zzu.edu.cn/ecilab/Papers_lj/Journal_Article.htm>.

## How to run

Just execute the "benchmark.m" script in MATLAB. Our test was made with MATLAB R2020a.
